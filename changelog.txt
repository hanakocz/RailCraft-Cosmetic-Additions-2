Changelog
---------


Build 3.0.5
- fixed carts not opening due to usage of clientside function. Affected servers.
- REHAUL OF ENTITIES for Carts, that means all carts get killed on world load after this update! BACKUP YOUR WORLDS, and possibly put all carts into inventory before updating! And yes, it was necessary.
- fixed crash when clicking on platform blocks by updating minimum RC version to apropriate one. (yes RC has update, you need at least 10.1.0 version!)

Build 3.0.4
- fixed cart names in inventories, also they now drop unnamed by default as they should
- fixed carts not dropping themself but the vanilla cart
- new Cage Cart. Usable to transport animals and so. Player cannot directly ride it, but can get inside, if used boarding track. Preparations for more entity-carrying carts in future.
- Grass Track and CobWeb tracks are back in. Both are right-click shearable back into regular track, with little chance to ruin the track into abandoned one. Do your Maintenance!

Build 3.0.3
- changed Creative tab Icon to new fancy one :)
- Platform Block: as old one, but in new habit. It has 4 versions, full, edge, outer and inner corners. Can be interchanged via crafting or using RC's Spike Maul in world. Can be rotated in world via Crowbar. Planned more textures. Is 3/4 blocks high, connects to fences etc.
- removed one forgotten system.out.println() . Sorry for that!
- updates to chinese lang file as it grows :)
Planned: some new carts and rest of blocks.

Build 3.0.2
- Recipes made properly, so they are available even when certain blocks aren't (railcraft tank for example, or if you disable plates) - fixes NEI crash with recipe using nonexistant block.
- Hand signals, two variants, dispatch and stop one. Probably most of world is not using them already, but in certain railroad-centered countries those were used extensively. Maybe in future will add flag/light variants.
- Train Dispatcher Cap, red variant of existing one. Also used extensively in certain countries.
- Added zh_CN.lang, thanks to @TartaricAcid If you also want your language in, feel free to contact me on Github.
